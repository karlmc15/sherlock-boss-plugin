To build this plugin, the easiest way is to use Eclipse. Checkout this project
into an Eclipse project. Make sure you checkout BOSS2
(http://github.com/tranngocthachs/BOSS2) into a project in Eclipse as well and
add that project to the build path of this project. Then just use the export
JAR function of Eclipse. Make sure you include both /src and /lib folder and
also point Eclipse to the supplied MANIFEST.MF file. You can then proceed with
the export and in the end you will have a proper plugin JAR file which can then
be installed into an instance of BOSS2.
